## History üìö

This project ([tarkov-dev](https://github.com/the-hideout/tarkov-dev)) is a fork of [tarkov-tools.com](https://github.com/kokarn/tarkov-tools). The original creator [@kokarn](https://github.com/kokarn) decided to shut the site down. In the spirit of open source, a group of developers came together to revive the site in order to continue providing a great website for the Tarkov community and an API to power further development for creators. This project is now 100% open source (see infrastructure section below) and developer first. Our GitHub Organization ([the-hideout](https://github.com/the-hideout)) contains all the repos which power the API, this website, the community Discord bot, server infrastructure, and much more! We are passionate about open source and love pull requests to improve our ecosystem for all.

## We ‚ù§Ô∏è Pull Requests

We love pull requests and contributors looking to improve this project! Anything from simple spelling errors, icon updates, fixes for small css bugs or just posting issues to keep track of what needs to be done is greatly appreciated.

## Updating Languages üåê

There are two *ways* to update languages on the site:

- Updating the core translations (most common)
- Updating the language that the GraphQL API uses (least common)

### Language Translations

Rather than go into detail here, we have opened a great guide in a GitHub issue for how you can provide translation contributions to tarkov.dev!

> Check out the guide [here](https://github.com/the-hideout/tarkov-dev/issues/175)

### GraphQL API Language Support

To update the supported languages used by the site with the **GraphQL API**, you will need to edit the following file: [`supported-languages.json`](https://github.com/the-hideout/tarkov-dev/blob/main/src/data/supported-languages.json)

> See this [pull request](https://github.com/the-hideout/tarkov-dev/pull/123) for additional context
