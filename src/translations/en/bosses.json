He has a large number of well-armed guards, some of whom are former military men who have organized a strong defense for him. The boss dwells in the area of the car repair shop on \"Streets of Tarkov\". The area is heavily defended, entrances are fortified with stationary machine guns and AGS, the paths are mined, and there are snipers on the roof of the car service center.

Thanks to his physical strength and bold temperament, after the events of the TerraGroup scandal, he formed a gang and began to do what he himself was recently supposed to combat - looting and banditry. However, even before the conflict, he often provided protection to local \"businessmen\". For example, his good relations with Kaban are well-known.",

He is known to be friendly with the Rogue group, as well as with the hooded men who draw mysterious symbols on the locations.<br/>Zryachiy is very taciturn, though those who work with him usually understand him without words. There are many rumors about his eyes, some say that it is an inborn peculiarity, some point to certain eye drops that allow him to enhance his vision in the dark, giving his eyes this whiteness side effect.
