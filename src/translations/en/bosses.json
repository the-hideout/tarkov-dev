He's active immediately at the start of raid. The boss can set ambushes open suppressive fire and breach if needed.",

Virtually nothing is known about his past, except that he has sniper training and is remotely rumored to have been in hot zones in the Middle East and Africa many times.<br/>Long before the conflict, he became Lightkeeper's loyal lapdog and took an active part in \"establishing\" connections between Lightkeeper and all those with whom he interacted. He is known to be friendly with the Rogue group, as well as with the hooded men who draw mysterious symbols on the locations.<br/>Zryachiy is very taciturn, though those who work with him usually understand him without words. There are many rumors about his eyes, some say that it is an inborn peculiarity, some point to certain eye drops that allow him to enhance his vision in the dark, giving his eyes this whiteness side effect. Despite the appearance, it seems that he earned his name precisely for his excellent eyesight, which is not surprising for a former military sniper.",
